# Shiny inputs for flight orgin and destination

### Background

Given that your flight was delayed by 15 minutes or more, what is the likelihood 
your airline carrier will make up time in route? Some of the most signficant factors 
for making up time are flight distance and airline carrier. The data model behind 
this dashboard is based on flights from NYC airports in 2013.

### Observed versus predicted time gain

```{r}
# Aggregregate time gain by carrier and by route 
plot_data <- reactive({
  req(input$origin, input$dest)
  pred_data %>%
    filter(origin==input$origin & dest==input$dest) %>%
    rename(airline = name) %>%
    group_by(airline) %>%
    summarize(
      flights = sum(freq),
      distance = weighted.mean(distance, freq),
      avg_dep_delay = weighted.mean(dep_delay, freq),
      avg_arr_delay = weighted.mean(arr_delay, freq),
      avg_gain = weighted.mean(gain, freq),
      pred_gain = weighted.mean(pred, freq)
  )
})

# Plot observed versus predicted time gain for carriers and route
renderPlot({
  ggplot(plot_data(), aes(factor(airline), pred_gain)) + 
    geom_bar(stat = "identity") +
    geom_point(aes(factor(airline), avg_gain)) +
    coord_flip() +
    labs(x = "", y = "Time gained in flight (minutes)") +
    labs(title = "Observed gain (point) vs Predicted gain (bar)")
})
```

### Route

```{r}
# Identify origin lat and long
origin <- reactive({
  req(input$origin)
  filter(airports, faa == input$origin)
  })

# Identify destination lat and log
dest <- reactive({
  req(input$dest)
  filter(airports, faa == input$dest)
})

# Plot route
renderLeaflet({
  gcIntermediate(
    select(origin(), lon, lat),
    select(dest(), lon, lat),
    n=100, addStartEnd=TRUE, sp=TRUE
    ) %>%
    leaflet() %>%
    addProviderTiles("CartoDB.Positron") %>%
    addPolylines()
})
```

### Data details

```{r}
# Print table of observed and predicted gains by airline
renderDataTable(
  datatable(plot_data()) %>%
    formatRound(c("flights", "distance"), 0) %>%
    formatRound(c("avg_arr_delay", "avg_dep_delay", "avg_gain", "pred_gain"), 1)
)
